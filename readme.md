Online shop store webpage.
## Documentation to my project
My web page is about online store. Inside this store user can register, 
after registration can login and also logout from webpage.
I have **6** tables which you can see in screenshot below. Al tables are related to each other 
via foreigh keys. Then I have relationships like ***user can leave resume***, ***user can give feedback***,
***user add products to carts*** and etc. User add products to carts, then user can go inside carts and finish
ordering if he/she wish. Also user can switch between 2 language : rus and eng.<br/>
All conditions such as *file uploading*, *email sending*, *localization*, *at least 2 table* - are met.
